.Sh NAME
.Nm qnet
.Nd qrun wrapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm qnet
.Op Ar config
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
by default will use
.Dq cfg
for the
.Ar config
file.
.Pp
By default, bridging networking will be used, so running
.Nm
as root is required.
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section below for a sample config.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
No environment variables are useful at this time.
.Sh EXAMPLES
It is best to set up the template hard drive image first via
.Xr qrun 1
then let
.Nm
create the machine specific images per system in the config file.
.Nm
uses the
.Dq based
support of qcow2 in
.Xr qemu 1
which permits only writing changes to the per machine disk image.
Below is a sample config for
.Nm .
